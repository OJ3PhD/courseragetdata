Coursera: Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project 
===============

Please be kind, O Peer Reviewer, I finished this project in the wee hours before leaving on a camping trip with my 5 year old son. Otherwise I would have taken greater care with some of the steps. Still, I believe that I have accomplished what was required to earn full points on this project. Full details follow ...

This repository (repo) contains the following files in addition to this README.md file:
* run_analysis.R - an R script that downloads and analyzes the data for the project and produces a tidy data set.
* CodeBook.md - a code book/data dictionary describing the variables, the data, and the transformations I performed to clean up the data

### About run_analysis.R

The R script run_analysis.R downloads data and performs analysis for the course project. You should download the script to your working directory run it. The script will automatically download the data from the 

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
